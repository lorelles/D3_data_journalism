          <p>Utilizing data from the US Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, this chart displays trends between median household income, median age, percentage of smokers, and percentage of obesity per state.</p>

          <p>Click on each item on the axes to choose between age or income, and smoking or obesity, respectively. Simply hover over each state's data points to display the numbers associated with the given data.</p>

          <p>There appears to be a potential inverse correlation between lower median income and a higher percentage of smokers and obesity. West Virginia has the second lowest median income and highest percentage of smokers as well as the second highest percentage of obesity. While Maryland has the highest median income and fourth lowest percentage of smokers, it's rate of obesity does not follow a similar trend. Each state's percentage of smokers appears to have few outliers, such as Utah and Alaska.</p>

          <p>There is not as obvious of a trend between age and smoking, however it can be seen that the average age ranges between 33.3 and 44.1 years old, except for Utah with the lowest meadian age at 30.5 years and also the lowest rate of smokers at 9.7%, which is interesting. It is important to note that the highest rate of smokers is in West Virginia, at 26.7%.</p>

          <p>Arkansas is topping the charts in obesity, with a staggering 35.9% of the population effected. The lowest rate is in Colorado, which weighs in at 21.3%; so even the state with lowest rate is still effecting nearly a quarter of the population.</p> 
            
          <p>While further analysis is required to prove a meaningful statistical correlation, one can draw the conclusion that there appears to be econimic and age-related factors that attribute to health risks disproportionately effecting those within certain demographics.</p>

          <p>The data provided for this chart was obtained from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.</p>
